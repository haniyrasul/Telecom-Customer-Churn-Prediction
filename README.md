# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction

In the dynamic landscape of the telecommunications industry, understanding and mitigating customer churn has become a critical aspect for service providers. As customer expectations evolve and market competition intensifies, telecom companies are compelled to address the challenges associated with retaining their customer base. The ability to predict and prevent customer churn not only preserves revenue but also contributes to the overall sustainability and success of the business.

This project centres around the analysis of customer churn in the telecommunications sector, leveraging a comprehensive dataset obtained from Kaggle titled "WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn_new_ad". The dataset encompasses a diverse range of customer-related attributes, allowing us to delve deep into the factors influencing churn behaviour.

The primary objective of this project is to employ advanced analytical techniques to uncover patterns, trends, and predictors associated with customer churn. By gaining insights from the provided dataset, we aim to develop predictive models that can assist telecom companies in proactively identifying customers at risk of churning. Ultimately, the findings of this project will contribute valuable insights to the telecom industry, facilitating strategic decision-making and the implementation of targeted retention strategies.
